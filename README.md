# Cold-Plasma-Jet
Novel Medical Cold Plasma Jet with Embedded System
   After the literature review, we understand that power source plays the device's prominent role. If we can design a variable, compatible, safe and stable Powe supply for any potential application, we passed an essential step toward the best final product and leading device designing.

   The power supply of Cold Plasma device has a unique situation in Electrical Engineering because of a precise collaboration of main fields of this science, including;
1-	Telecommunications Engineering (Especially in function generator and noise filtering)
2-	Electronics (Esp. in switching circuit)
3-	Power electronics (Esp. in transformation and insulations)
4-	Control Engineering
5-	Electromagnetics (Esp. in interaction with Cold Plasma Jet)

But this effort didn’t deserve the title of design and engineering and was merely a practical exercise.
